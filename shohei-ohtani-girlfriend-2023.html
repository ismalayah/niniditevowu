While he has been frequently linked to Kamalani Dung, we confirm that they're not in a relationship as Kamalani is dating her long-time boyfriend, Dillion Pakele.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong></a>, a Japanese <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>baseball pitcher</strong></a> known as <strong>Shotime</strong>, gained national attention for his exceptional pitching and playing abilities. And this young star has already won the All-Star MLB award both as a pitcher and hitter and has established himself as the most significant two-way player of the century.</p><p>Ohtani was the first pick of the<strong> Fighters</strong> in the 2012 draft and was regarded early on as an elite two-way player. He was a pitcher and outfielder for the Fighters from 2013 to 2017, and he helped them win the Japan Series in 2016. After the 2017 season, the Fighters released Ohtani to MLB, and he signed with the<strong> Angels,</strong> where he quickly won the 2018 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award.</p><p>Recently, we've discovered that many of Shohei Ohtani's fans have been curious to know about her personal life. They want to know if he has a girlfriend or a wife in 2023. Well, here's everything you need to know about his love life.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Hailey Van Lith</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ryan Garcia</strong></a>.</p><h2>Shohei Ohtaniâ€™s Girlfriend/Wife in 2023: The Baseball Pitcher Does Not Seem to Have a Partner Right Now and Is Definitely Not in a Relationship With Kamalani Dung!</h2><p><strong>No, Shohei Ohtani</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@shoheiohtani</a>) does not have a girlfriend or a wife in 2023. The 28-year-old athlete has neither announced anything about his love life nor had been spotted with anybody else. It's safe to assume he likes to keep his personal life very private. However, many people believe he has been dating&nbsp;<strong>Kamalani Dung&nbsp;</strong>ever since she posted a picture of them together in 2018.</p><p>No one wants to be the bearer of bad news, especially when it comes to dating rumors involving athletes, which can happen or not, as our pair Kamalani and Shohei discovered. Shohei Ohtani and Kamalani have been seen several times together over the years, but the star has frequently avoided questions about his personal life. However, the photos of them together have sparked massive speculation on the internet in the name of dating news.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/03/shohei-ohtani-rumored-girlfriend.jpg alt="Shohei Ohtani and his rumored girlfriend, Kamalani Dung." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Shohei Ohtani and his rumored girlfriend, Kamalani Dung.</strong><br><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Kamalani Dung (<a href=# rel=noopener>@kama.dung</a>) is a professional softball pitcher who competes in the Puerto Rican National Softball League and the Athletes Unlimited Softball League. She was born in Waianae, Hawaii, and is a model, actress, and philanthropist. In her Instagram bio, she describes herself as a believer and the founder.</p><p>Kamalani has been a sports fan since she was a child. She has been involved in sports since the age of ten, eventually gaining popularity in Baseball and invading her career. Her earnings and fame came entirely from her own achievements, but after sharing a photo with Ohtani, she found herself in the spotlight of the media, and her social platforms are flooded with new followers eager to learn more about her and Ohtani.</p><p>Kamalani and Shohei are both extremely talented athletes who enjoy their common sport, Baseball. In March 2022, Kamalani shared photos of herself hugging Shohei and wishing him luck for the upcoming match. The photo literally shook the media world, and it all began with questions and unknown facts. Unfortunately, we have a confirmation that they've never had a relationship since Kamalani is in a relationship with her <a href=# rel=noopener>long-term boyfriend</a>,<strong> Dillion Pakele</strong>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/03/kamalani-dung-boyfriend.jpg alt="Kamalani Dung and her boyfriend, Dillion Pakele." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>Kamalani Dung and her boyfriend, Dillion Pakele.<br>Source: Instagram</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Prior to Kamalani, there were no indications or rumors of Shohei Ohtani's girlfriend or anyone close to him.
