Here are <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">some of the movies</a> in which the actor has appeared, along with their box office earnings:</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Box Office Earnings</th><th>Years</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</td><td>$897.7 million</td><td>2001</td></tr><tr><td>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</td><td>$947.5 million</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</td><td>$373.1 million</td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td>Soldiers of Fortune</td><td>$1.572 million</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</td><td>$962.2 million</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Atomica</td><td>$100 million</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker</td><td>$1.074 billion</td><td>2019</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is no doubt that Monaghan’s earnings from the films mentioned above are enormous.

Given that he had similar roles in the films to theirs, Dominic Monaghan’s salary might have also been in the same range.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actor has had the good fortune to work in several big-budget films and television series over the years.
